WIP.

A template for writing next awesome TypeScript library/project.

## The idea

The idea behind this project is to provide a ready-to-use base for writing a library or end project in TypeScript, with
all the tools needed without days wasted on Googling random error messages produces by TS/JS ecosystem hell.

See also JS-only, previous project: [js-library-template][1]. This project should replace it.
